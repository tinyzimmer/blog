Welcome to my new blog where I am going to start documenting my code adventures in more detail.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, constantly going between lockdowns, the one thing I realized I needed the most was my routines.
The usual ones were not an option, so I dedicated myself to side projects that ventured me outside of my comfort zone. 
Regretfully, I didn't blog about them at the time, so this will become a place for me to retroactively go over some of those projects, and to continue documenting new ones in the future :smile:.
